# 🚀 Mastering C++ OOP – Adil Amjad 😀

Welcome to my journey of learning and mastering C++ from the ground up — with a focus on clarity, real-world logic, and preparation for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. This repository is structured into **phases** to reflect my progress from basic concepts to advanced topics like **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 📚 Folder Breakdown

### 1️⃣ **OOP Foundation**
> Laying the groundwork with core **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts.

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation (Access Specifiers, Data Hiding)
- Constructors, Destructors, and `this` Pointer
- Shallow & Deep Copy
- Abstraction and Pure Virtual Functions

---

### 2️⃣ **OOP Pillars**
> Understanding the four pillars of OOP in depth: **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction**.

- Key Concepts of **Inheritance** (Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hybrid)
- **Polymorphism** (Function Overriding, Virtual Functions)
- **Abstraction** (Abstract Classes, Pure Virtual Functions)
- **Encapsulation** (Private, Public, Protected Access)

---

### 3️⃣ **OOP Essentials**
> Advanced OOP concepts in C++ for building powerful systems.

- **Static Keyword** (Static Members and Functions)
- **Copy Constructor** (Customizing Object Copies)
- **Function Overriding** and **Virtual Functions**
- Deep dive into memory management and resource control in C++ OOP.

---

## 💡 What I'm Practicing

- Clean, modular code writing
- Real-world logic implementation through OOP concepts
- Emphasis on **maintainability**, **reusability**, and **scalability**
- Structuring GitHub repositories professionally
- Using **OOP** techniques to solve practical, real-world problems

---

## 📌 Roadmap Ahead

- ✅ **OOP Foundation Concepts**
- ✅ **Understanding OOP Pillars**
