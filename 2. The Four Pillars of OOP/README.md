| Topic                              | Description                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation**                  | Learned to protect the internal state of an object and provide controlled access through methods.      |
| **Inheritance**                    | Explored how to model hierarchical relationships between classes, enabling code reuse and extension.   |
| **Abstraction**                    | Implemented abstract classes and pure virtual functions to hide complex implementation details.        |
| **Polymorphism**                   | Focused on runtime polymorphism using function overriding to allow dynamic method dispatch.            |

### ðŸ’¡ **Experience & Learning Reflection**

This section focused on understanding the **core principles** of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These pillars â€” **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism** â€” are fundamental to building clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Throughout this phase, I have:

- **Mastered the key OOP pillars**, learning how to protect data, extend class behavior, hide complexity, and implement flexible, reusable code.
- **Applied OOP principles** to solve real-world problems, creating software that models real-life entities effectively and efficiently.
- Developed a **deeper understanding** of how OOP enhances code maintainability, scalability, and flexibility in complex systems.

These concepts have paved the way for a stronger grasp of C++ and will be pivotal as I move on to more advanced topics like **memory management** and **data structures**.

### ðŸ“˜ **What's Next**

In the next phase, I will focus on:

- **Advanced OOP Concepts** (Operator Overloading, Virtual Functions)
- **Memory Management** and **Pointers** in C++
- **Design Patterns** to structure large-scale applications
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with C++

### ðŸ“Œ **Why Mastering the Four Pillars of OOP Matters**

âœ… Builds a **strong foundation** for **advanced software development**  
âœ… Enhances **problem-solving capabilities** in **technical interviews** and **competitive programming**  
âœ… Prepares for **designing scalable, maintainable systems** in **system-level programming**  
âœ… Strengthens **backend development** skills, especially in **MERN stack** applications  
âœ… Forms the base for creating **high-performance software solutions** in real-world scenarios
