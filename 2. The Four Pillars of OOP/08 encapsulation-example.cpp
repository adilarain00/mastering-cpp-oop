/*
Explanation:

- Private members `owner` and `balance` are only accessible through public methods.
- This protects data from being modified directly â€” key concept of encapsulation.
- All interaction happens through controlled methods (deposit, withdraw, showBalance).

Output:

Adil's Balance: $1300
