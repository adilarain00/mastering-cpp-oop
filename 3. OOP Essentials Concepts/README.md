### âœ… **Topics Covered So Far**

| Topic                             | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Keyword**                | Explored how to use static members to share variables or methods across all instances of a class.        |
| **Copy Constructor**              | Implemented custom copy constructors to control how objects are copied, especially for dynamic memory.   |
| **Function Overriding**           | Learned how to override base class methods in derived classes to achieve runtime polymorphism.           |
| **Virtual Functions**             | Worked with virtual functions to enable dynamic dispatch and allow derived classes to modify base class behavior. |

### ðŸ’¡ **Experience & Learning Reflection**

This section has been instrumental in mastering advanced **OOP concepts** in C++. The key topics such as **static members, copy constructors, function overriding, and virtual functions** are crucial for designing robust systems. Through this phase, I have:

- Gained a **deeper understanding** of how to **control object behaviors** and **memory management** using advanced OOP techniques.
- Strengthened my skills in **managing object copies** and **handling dynamic behavior** with virtual functions and function overriding.
- Learned how to leverage the **static keyword** to ensure shared resources and states across multiple instances of a class.

These concepts allow for **cleaner code** that is **more maintainable** and **flexible** while also preparing me for more complex tasks in C++ and real-world software development.

### ðŸ“˜ **What's Next**

In the next phase, I will dive into:

- **Design Patterns** (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using C++
