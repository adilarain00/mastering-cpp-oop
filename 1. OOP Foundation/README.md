### âœ… **Topics Covered So Far**

| Topic                              | Description                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------          | 
| **Introduction to OOP**            | Explored the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, including objects and classes.     |
| **Classes & Objects**              | Learned how to define and instantiate classes and objects to represent real-world entities.           |
| **Access Specifiers**              | Covered private, public, and protected access levels, managing data encapsulation and protection.     |
| **Encapsulation**                  | Implemented data hiding to protect object states and ensure controlled access through methods.        |
| **Constructors & Destructors**     | Worked with special functions to initialize objects and clean up resources during object destruction. |
| **`this` Pointer**                 | Investigated the use of the `this` pointer for referring to the current object inside class methods.  |
| **Shallow & Deep Copy**            | Analyzed the difference between shallow and deep copies, implementing custom copy constructors.       |
| **Abstraction**                    | Used abstract classes and pure virtual functions to hide implementation details.                      |
| **Inheritance**                    | Learned how to model hierarchical relationships between classes using inheritance.                    |
| **Polymorphism**                   | Implemented dynamic method dispatch with function overriding, enabling runtime polymorphism.          |

### ðŸ’¡ **Experience & Learning Reflection**

This phase laid the foundation for my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in C++. Each topic has allowed me to:

- **Understand real-world modeling** using objects and classes, making code more modular and maintainable.
- **Master the key concepts** like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction that are crucial for writing efficient, scalable software.
- **Implement powerful OOP features** such as constructors, destructors, and polymorphism for creating flexible systems.
- **Build clean, organized code** with focus on reusability, minimizing redundancy, and ensuring proper encapsulation.

By applying these concepts, I've developed a much clearer and more structured approach to coding, which will be essential as I continue my journey into advanced C++ and software development.

### ðŸ“˜ **What's Next**

In the next phase, I will dive deeper into:

- **Pillars of OOP** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction and Polymorphism)
- **OOP Advanced Concepts** (Operator Overloading, Virtual Functions)
- **Memory Management** and **Pointers**
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with C++
